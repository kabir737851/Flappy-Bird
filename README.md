Flappy Bird is a fun and addictive game where you control a small bird trying to fly through gaps between green pipes. The bird constantly falls due to gravity, and your job is to tap or press a key to make it flap upward. The challenge is to time your jumps perfectly so the bird doesn't hit any pipes or fall to the ground. Each set of pipes you pass increases your score. It's a simple game with easy controls but can be quite tricky and engaging!
